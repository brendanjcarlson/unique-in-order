# Implement a function which takes in a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.

# For example:
# 'AAAABBBCCDAABBB' => ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B']
# 'ABBCcAD' => ['A', 'B', 'C', 'c', 'A', 'D']
# [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2] => [1, 2, 3, 2]
